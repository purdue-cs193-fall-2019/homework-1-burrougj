# Julia Burroughs's First CS 193 Homework
Things I like about CS 193:
- it is taught by people my age (I'm a junior please be my friends)
- I know a lot of this stuff but its a great refresher especially because I haven't seen it in a while
- I get to be a super cool hacker now
- idk its very different from any other class I'm in and I think its gonna be interesting
